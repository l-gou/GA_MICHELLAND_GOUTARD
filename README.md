Exercise 3: one code to solve them all
You have solved two different problems using genetic algorithms. By now you may have a clearer idea of which parts are problem-specific and which parts can be made generic to any given problem. The goal of this exercise is to rely on this recent experience and reuse the code you’ve just produced to create one single genetic algorithm package.
You should have a generic “core” that is applicable to any problems solvable with a genetic algorithm. The problems you solved in exercises 1 and 2 may become examples of how to reuse your generic core for a particular problem.


- A file ga_solver.py: a template for your generic class(es) related to the genetic algorithm solver
- A file tsp_problem.py: A template for your example of GA solving TSP
- A file mastermind_problem.py: A template for your example of GA solving the Mastermind game
